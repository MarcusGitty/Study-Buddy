## Scope
A Mobile App (Android) will provide an interface to access the study planner that has a to do list, study timer and assignment reminder.
 
A Web-based App will share a common database with the Mobile App and provide the same functionality.


## Inspiration
As students, we constantly juggle with catching up on lessons and new materials, keeping  up our grades, and also keeping track of our assignments and exams. To help us solve these problems and avoid procrastination and rushing at the last minute, it would be nice to have a study planner that’s able to keep track of our learning progress, assignments and exams, and allow us to manage our study materials in one place. 
The app is aimed to be an all in one app that is customizable to help you study and stay organized. To make it more convenient and accessible, the app will also be available to use in both website and mobile.
